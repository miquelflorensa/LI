|= ∧ ∨ ¬ ≡


F -> G is a tautology iff F |= G

	F -> G is a tautology iff							by def of ->
	-F v G is a tautology iff 							by def of tautology
	for all I, I |= -F v G iff							by def of |=
			I, evalI(-F v G) = 1 iff					by def of evaluation of v
			I, max(evalI (-F) ,evalI (G)) = 1 iff		by def of evaluation of -
			I, max(1 - evalI (F), evalI(G)) = 1	iff		by def of max
			I, 1 - evalI(F) = 1 or evalI(G) = 1 iff		by def of -
			I, evalI(F) = 0 or evalI(G) = 1 iff			by def of |=
			I, I |/= F or I |= G iff					by def of logical consequence
